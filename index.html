        <article>The winter time can be cool for some fun activites. Like sledding or snowboarding.
            It also makes time for everyones family to come together. Which a lot of people enjoy. 
            There is also Christmas which is always fun for most kids and families.

        <article>In the winter time, you cant do any of the fun activities that are possible in the summer.
            And while there may be some fun activities in the winter, it is always cold for no reason and no 
            one wants to stay outside for that long. It also creates danger for many drivers on the roads.
            Every morning there is a new wreck on the news. Or I even hear about the ice caused wrecks at school.
